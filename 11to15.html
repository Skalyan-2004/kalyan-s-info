        <h2>from 11 to 15 years</h2>
        <p>From ages 11 to 15, I felt like I was entering the early stages of <strong>>adulthood</strong>. During this time, I completed my primary education. <strong> these years, my main goal was to achieve high marks in my SSC exams, aiming for a perfect 10.</strong>

            One of my proudest moments during this phase was managing a farewell event. I was the event lead for a <strong>team of 30 members,</strong> and it was an incredible experience. Organizing the event involved a lot of planning, coordination, and teamwork. We had to arrange everything from the venue and decorations to the program schedule and refreshments.
            
            The farewell event turned out to be a huge success. Seeing all our hard work come to fruition and receiving positive feedback from teachers and classmates was incredibly rewarding. It was a proud moment for me, as it showed that I could lead a team and successfully manage a significant event.
            
            In addition to my academic and leadership achievements, I also enjoyed participating in various extracurricular activities. I joined the school's debate team, where I improved my public speaking skills and learned to build strong arguments. I also played on the school's soccer team, which helped me stay active and taught me the importance of teamwork and perseverance.
            
            Overall, my years from 11 to 15 were filled with personal growth, academic achievements, and memorable experiences. These years laid a strong foundation for my future endeavors and helped shape who I am today.</p>
