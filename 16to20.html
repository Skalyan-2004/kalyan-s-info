        <h2>16 to 20 years</h2>
        <p>From ages 16 to 20, I entered university-level education. This phase of my life was challenging and filled with numerous problems.<strong>I often felt stressed and unhappy, as various issues seemed to constantly arise.</strong> 

            Despite these difficulties, I made significant efforts to improve my well-being. I joined a yoga class, which helped me find some peace and balance amidst the chaos. Practicing yoga regularly allowed me to manage my stress better and gave me a sense of calm.
            
            In addition to yoga, I also joined the National Cadet Corps (NCC) and the National Service Scheme (NSS). Completing these programs successfully was a major achievement for me. The NCC taught me discipline, leadership, and resilience, while the NSS gave me opportunities to engage in community service and make a positive impact on society.
            
            These activities provided me with valuable life skills and a sense of accomplishment, even during a tough period. They also helped me build a support network of friends and mentors who were there for me when times were hard.
            
            Although my university years were filled with challenges, they also taught me resilience and the importance of self-care. By participating in yoga, NCC, and NSS, I found ways to cope with stress and emerge stronger from my experiences. These years were a crucial part of my personal growth and development.
