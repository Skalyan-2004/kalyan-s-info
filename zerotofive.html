    <h2>First five years</h2>
    <p>In the first five years of my life, my days were filled with a peaceful simplicity. <strong> world revolved around eating, sleeping,</strong> and exploring the wonders of my surroundings with a curious yet innocent mind. My heart was light, and my mind, free of worries, found joy in the smallest of things.

        There was one particular incident from my childhood that I remember vividly. It happened one sunny afternoon when I was playing outside, full of energy and enthusiasm. I was running around, my laughter echoing in the air, when I tripped over a small rock. <strong>I fell forward and hit my forehead, resulting in a small injury</strong>. I cried out in pain, but soon enough, my family rushed to my side, comforting me with their warm embraces and soothing words.
        
        Despite the injury, I continued to be a happy and carefree child. My days were filled with play, laughter, and the love of my family. However, I always had a yearning to learn more, to understand the world beyond my immediate experiences. I longed for a place where I could begin my journey of education.
        
        One day, my family decided it was time for me to start attending nursery school. I was excited at the prospect of learning new things and making new friends. The first day of nursery school was a big step for me, a chance to expand my horizons and <strong> start my educational journey</strong>.
