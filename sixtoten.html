        <h2>From six to ten years</h2>
        <p>From ages 6 to 10, I completed my elementary school studies, from 1st to 5th grade. Those years were full of new experiences and learning opportunities. I was known as a <strong>funny guy at school,</strong> always making my classmates laugh with my jokes and antics.

            However, I often struggled with my homework. Despite my enthusiasm for learning, I found it hard to sit down and complete my assignments. This led to some trouble at home, as my father would get upset and sometimes even resort to discipline because I wasnâ€™t doing my homework.
            
            Despite this, I had many happy moments at school. I loved participating in class activities and playing with my friends during recess. One of my favorite subjects was science, where we did fun experiments and learned about the world around us. I also enjoyed art class, where I could express my creativity through drawing and painting.
            
            One memorable incident was when our class went on a field trip to the local zoo. I was fascinated by the animals and asked the zookeepers countless questions about their habits and habitats. This trip sparked a deeper interest in animals and nature for me.
            
            Through all the ups and downs, those early school years shaped who I am today.<strong> I learned the importance of balancing fun and responsibility,</strong> and my natural curiosity continued to drive my love for learning.
